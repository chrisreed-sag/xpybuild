[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/xpybuild/xpybuild.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/xpybuild/xpybuild)

XPyBuild is a cross-platform, cross-language, multi-threaded build system that uses Python as the build file format. 

It combines the best features of Make with those from Ant along with an easy to use but powerful blend of declarative statements and imperative python code.

XPyBuild requires Python 3.6+. 

The values behind this build system are:
   - correct build
   - fast, parallelisable, scalable build
   - simple build files, all complexities abstracted away in reusable helper 
       classes
   - fail-early on build configuration bugs (e.g. setting an unknown property)

Key concepts:
   - properties - immutable values specified by build files or overridden on 
       command line. May be path, a string, True/False or list. 
       Can be evaluated using "${propertyName}. All properties must be defined 
       in a build file before they can be used. 
   - target - something that generates an output file (or directory)
       if the output file doesn't exist or is out of date with respect to 
       other targets it depends on; has the ability to clean/delete any 
       generated output. 
       Targets are named based on their output file, but may also have 
       tags to make referring to them easier. 
   - tag - an alias for a target or set of targets, grouped together to make 
       running them easier from the command line
   - PathSet - an object that specifies a set of on-disk files/directories, 
       typically used as the source of targets (e.g. Copy) or to indicate 
       dependencies. PathSets can efficiently detect whether their source 
       files are up-to-date, and also have the ability to specify a 
       "destination" for each source path, which is used by targets such as 
       Copy.
